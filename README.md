Thunderbird for Android is a powerful, privacy-focused email app. Effortlessly manage multiple email accounts from one app, with a Unified Inbox option for maximum productivity. Built on open-source technology and supported by a dedicated team of developers alongside a global community of volunteers, Thunderbird never treats your private data as a product.

Thunderbird for Android is based on K-9 Mail, which comes with a rich history of success and functionality in open source email.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

We use [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) to document the architectural decisions made in the
development of Thunderbird for Android. You can find them in the [`docs/architecture/adr`](docs/architecture/adr) directory.

For more information about our ADRs, please see the [ADRs README](docs/architecture/adr/README.md).

We encourage team members and contributors to read through our ADRs to understand the architectural decisions that
have shaped this project so far. Feel free to propose new ADRs or suggest modifications to existing ones as needed.

## K-9 Mail

In June 2022, [K-9 Mail joined the Thunderbird family](https://k9mail.app/2022/06/13/K-9-Mail-and-Thunderbird.html)
as the foundation for Thunderbird on Android. Since then, we’ve been updating both apps to give
users the same solid experience, so it’s normal to notice that K-9 Mail and Thunderbird look and
feel nearly identical. They’re built on the same code, and that’s intentional. You'll notice some
features are selectively enabled for Thunderbird as opposed to K-9 Mail, usually when they are
simply a better fit for Thunderbird (like the import from K-9 functionality).

If you prefer the robot dog and would like to keep K-9 Mail around, you can find it here:

- [K-9 Mail on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9&utm_source=thunderbird-android-github&utm_campaign=download-section)
- [K-9 Mail on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9/)

## Forking

If you want to use a fork of this project please ensure that you replace the OAuth client setup in the `app-k9mail/src/{debug,release}/kotlin/app/k9mail/auth/K9OAuthConfigurationFactory.kt` and `app-thunderbird/src/{debug,daily,beta,release}/kotlin/net/thunderbird/android/auth/TbOAuthConfigurationFactory.kt` with your own OAuth client setup and ensure that the `redirectUri` is different to the one used in the main project. This is to prevent conflicts with the main app when both are installed on the same device.
