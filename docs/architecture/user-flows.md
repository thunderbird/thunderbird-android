# User Flows

The user flows diagrams below illustrate typical paths users take through the application, helping developers
understand how different components interact from a user perspective.

## Verifying Flows

We plan to test these user flows using [maestro](https://maestro.dev/), a tool for automating UI tests. Maestro allows us to write tests in a
simple YAML format, making it easy to define user interactions and verify application behavior.

The current flows could be found in the *`ui-flows` directory in the repository.
