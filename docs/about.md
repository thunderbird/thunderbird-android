## üì® K‚Äë9 Mail heritage

Thunderbird for Android is based on **K‚Äë9 Mail**, a long‚Äëstanding open source email app. The projects share much of
the same code and therefore may look and feel similar.

Some features are selectively enabled in Thunderbird when they are a better fit for Thunderbird users (e.g., import from K‚Äë9).

If you prefer to keep using K‚Äë9 Mail, you can find it here:
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9)
- [F‚ÄëDroid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9/)
