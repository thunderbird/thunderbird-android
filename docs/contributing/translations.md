# 🌐 Translations

This document explains how you can help translate Thunderbird for Android into your language.

- All translations for Thunderbird for Android are managed in [Thunderbird for Android Weblate project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tb-android/).
- The Source language is **English** (American English, represented as `en`).
- Translations are done only in Weblate, not in this repository.
- The Thunderbird team regularly syncs Weblate with the repository to pull in translation updates.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a developer and need to add or manage strings or languages in the codebase, see [managing strings](managing-strings.md).

## 🚀 Getting started with Weblate

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with [documentation](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/).

To start translating Thunderbird for Android:

1. Create a [Weblate account](https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/signup/).
2. Go to the [Thunderbird for Android Weblate project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tb-android/).
3. Select your language from the list of languages.
4. Start translating strings through the Weblate web interface.

## 🔑 Translation Rules

- **Translate only on Weblate** - never edit translation directly in Git.
- **Preserve technical placeholders and formatting:**
  - Keep placeholders like `%s` or `%1$d` unchanged.
  - Preserve Xliff formatting such as `<xliff:g id="...">...</xliff:g>`.
  - Match punctuation with the source string unless language rules require otherwise.
- **Don’t change meaning** - if the English source string changes meaning, developers will create a new string key.

## 💡 Tips for Translators

- Use the **Comments** section in Weblate to ask questions or provide context.
- Check regularly for new strings to translate.
- Join the [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#tb-mobile-dev:mozilla.org) to connect with other translators and developers.

## 📦 Adding or Removing Languages

Languages included in app builds are decided by the development team based on **translation coverage**.

- A language must reach at least **70% coverage across all project components** before being shipped.
- If coverage falls below **60% for an extended period**, the language may be removed from builds.
- These thresholds are evaluated at each release cycle.

You can still contribute translations below the 70% threshold in Weblate. Once coverage improves, the language will be
added to future builds.

## ✅ Becoming a Reviewer

Reviewers help maintain translation quality by approving or correcting contributions.

To propose yourself as a reviewer:

1. Make consistent contributions for your language in Weblate.
2. Go to the [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#tb-mobile-dev:mozilla.org)
3. Post a short message like:

   ```text
   Hi, I would like to become a reviewer for [Language Name].
   My Weblate username is [Your Username].  
   Here is a link to my contributions: [Your Weblate Profile or Component Link].
   ```
4. The Thunderbird team will review your request and grant reviewer rights for that language if appropriate.

## 🌍 Requesting a New Language

If your language is not available in Weblate yet, you can request it be added.

To propose a new language:

1. Go to the [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#tb-mobile-dev:mozilla.org)
2. Post a short message like:

   ```text
   Hi, I would like to request adding a new language to Thunderbird for Android.  
   Language: [Language Name]  
   Code: [e.g., fr, pt_BR]
   Any special notes: [Optional]
   ```
3. The Thunderbird team will add the new language to Weblate.
4. Once it’s available, you can start translating immediately.

## 🙏 Thank You!

Every translation improves Thunderbird for Android for users worldwide.
We greatly appreciate your help in making the app accessible in more languages!
