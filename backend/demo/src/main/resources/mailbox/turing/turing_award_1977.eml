Conventional programming languages are growing ever more enormous, but not 
stronger. Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both 
fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited 
from their common ancestor--the von Neumann computer, their close coupling 
of semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a 
world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to 
effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from 
existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for 
reasoning about 
programs.
