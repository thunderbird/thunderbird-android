/**
 * Remove all placeholder entries in 'messages' table
 *
 * When the user moves or deletes an email, the row in the 'messages' table is first updated with 'deleted = 1', turning
 * it into a placeholder message. After the remote operation has completed, the row is removed.
 *
 * Placeholder messages are created to prevent an email from being downloaded again during a sync before the remote
 * operation has finished. The placeholder message is also necessary to remember deleted messages when using a delete
 * policy other than "delete from server".
 *
 * Previously these placeholder messages often weren't removed when they should have been. This will slowly grow the
 * database.
 * Here we remove all placeholder messages when the delete policy is "delete from server". This might also include
 * placeholder messages that shouldn't be removed, because the remote operation hasn't been performed yet.
 * However, since the app tries to execute all pending remote operations before doing a message sync, it's unlikely that
 * deleted messages are re-downloaded. And if they are, the next sync after the remote operation has completed will
 * remove them again.
