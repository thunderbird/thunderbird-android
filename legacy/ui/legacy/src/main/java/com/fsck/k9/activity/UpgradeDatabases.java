/**
 * This activity triggers a database upgrade if necessary and displays the current upgrade progress.
 *
 * <p>
 * The current upgrade process works as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Activities that access an account's database call
 *     {@link #actionUpgradeDatabases(Context, Intent)} in their {@link Activity#onCreate(Bundle)}
 *     method.</li>
 * <li>{@link #actionUpgradeDatabases(Context, Intent)} will call {@link K9#areDatabasesUpToDate()}
 *     to check if we already know whether the databases have been upgraded.</li>
 * <li>{@link K9#areDatabasesUpToDate()} will compare the last known database version stored in a
 *     {@link SharedPreferences} file to {@link LocalStore#getDbVersion()}. This
 *     is done as an optimization because it's faster than opening all of the accounts' databases
 *     one by one.</li>
 * <li>If there was an error reading the cached database version or if it shows the databases need
 *     upgrading this activity ({@code UpgradeDatabases}) is started.</li>
 * <li>This activity will display a spinning progress indicator and start
 *     {@link DatabaseUpgradeService}.</li>
 * <li>{@link DatabaseUpgradeService} will acquire a partial wake lock (with a 10 minute timeout),
 *     start a background thread to perform the database upgrades, and report the progress using
 *     {@link LocalBroadcastManager} to this activity which will update the UI accordingly.</li>
 * <li>Once the upgrade is complete {@link DatabaseUpgradeService} will notify this activity,
 *     release the wake lock, and stop itself.</li>
 * <li>This activity will start the original activity using the intent supplied when calling
 *     {@link #actionUpgradeDatabases(Context, Intent)}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p><p>
 * Currently we make no attempts to stop the background code (e.g. {@link MessagingController}) from
 * opening the accounts' databases. If this happens the upgrade is performed in one of the
 * background threads and not by {@link DatabaseUpgradeService}. But this is not a problem. Due to
 * the locking in {@link com.fsck.k9.mailstore.LocalStoreProvider#getInstance(LegacyAccountDto)} the upgrade service will block
 * and from the outside (especially for this activity) it will appear as if
 * {@link DatabaseUpgradeService} is performing the upgrade.
