The commons-io component contains utility classes,
filters, streams, readers and writers.
</p>
<p>
These classes aim to add to the standard JDK IO classes.
The utilities provide convenience wrappers around the JDK, simplifying
various operations into pre-tested units of code.
The filters and streams provide useful implementations that perhaps should
be in the JDK itself.
